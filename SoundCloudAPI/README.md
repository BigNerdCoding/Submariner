# The SoundCloud API Wrapper for Cocoa

So you want to use SoundCloud in your iOS or OSX Desktop Application? Awesome. This little project will help you do it.

The SoundCloud API Wrapper supports iOS from Version 3.0 and MacOS X from Leopard (10.5). It uses SoundClouds [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2) API and henceforth includes the [NXOAuth2Client](http://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client) project.

There's three parts to this Guide:

* How to [integrate the SoundCloud API Wrapper into your Project](https://github.com/soundcloud/cocoa-api-wrapper/blob/master/Setup.md).
* How to [use the SoundCloud API Wrapper](https://github.com/soundcloud/cocoa-api-wrapper/blob/master/Usage.md).
* How to [share your Audio using SoundCloud](https://github.com/soundcloud/cocoa-api-wrapper/blob/master/Sharing.md).

Afraid of doing the journey alone? Don't be, there's a lot of places where you can find help:

* The [SoundCloud API Documentation](http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs). You'll need this.
* The [SoundCloud API Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/soundcloudapi).
* If you're looking for additional documentation on this wrapper have a look at the [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/soundcloud/cocoa-api-wrapper/) where you'll find the documentation for [version 1](http://github.com/soundcloud/cocoa-api-wrapper/tree/v1.0).

Please keep in mind that all of this is under heavy development, and things might change from time to time. Please update your frameworks often, and keep this space in mind.

We document the [changes to the different versions](Changes.md). If you've used a previous version, please read it.

But most important: Have fun building great apps!

Your friends at SoundCloud.
