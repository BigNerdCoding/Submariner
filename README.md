# Submariner

## About

Submariner is a Subsonic client for Mac which is currently no more maintained. Because I received many requests about it, I decided to publish the sources code under BSD 3-clauses license. 

You have to know that this codebase is old and stay pretty untouched since 2012. I only fixed a few errors to make it compile against 10.9 SDK on Mavericks. 

I changed the bunlde identifier of the application to `fr.read-write.Submariner`, because Submariner was initialy developed as a proprietary software, with another trademark. 

## Development

Developers are welcome to directly contribute to the project by forking it on GitHub.com and by publishing pull-requests, or by using the sources code with respect of the attached license.

According to the direction this project will take, I will be glad to continue to distibute it as a binary from Read-Write.fr domain. But feel free if you want to lead your own project, while you respect terms of the attached license.
